# AI Agent Implementation Summary - ReAct Pattern

## Overview

Successfully implemented a **ReAct-pattern autonomous AI agent** for the meroku infrastructure management CLI. The agent can investigate and fix deployment errors automatically through iterative reasoning and action.

**Implementation Date**: October 22, 2025
**Status**: ✅ Complete and Ready for Testing

## What Was Built

A fully autonomous AI agent that uses the **ReAct pattern** (Reasoning + Acting) to debug and fix infrastructure problems iteratively, rather than following pre-planned scripts.

### Key Innovation: ReAct vs Traditional Helpers

**Traditional Helper**: Shows one suggestion, user executes manually
**Our AI Agent**: Thinks → Acts → Observes → Learns → Repeats until solved

## How the Agent Works

### ReAct Loop Example

```
Problem: ECS service deployment failing

Iteration 1:
  THINK: "Need to check ECS service status"
  ACT: aws ecs describe-services...
  OBSERVE: "Service has 0 running tasks"

Iteration 2:
  THINK: "Why no tasks? Check task definition"
  ACT: aws ecs describe-task-definition...
  OBSERVE: "Task execution role ARN is empty"

Iteration 3:
  THINK: "IAM role missing, add to terraform"
  ACT: file_edit env/dev/main.tf
  OBSERVE: "File updated successfully"

Iteration 4:
  THINK: "Apply terraform to create role"
  ACT: terraform apply
  OBSERVE: "Apply complete, role created"

Iteration 5:
  THINK: "Force new deployment with new role"
  ACT: aws ecs update-service --force-new-deployment
  OBSERVE: "Deployment started"

Iteration 6:
  THINK: "Verify service is healthy"
  ACT: aws ecs describe-services...
  OBSERVE: "1 task running, service stable"

Iteration 7:
  THINK: "Problem solved!"
  ACT: complete
```

**Key Point**: Each action is chosen dynamically based on what the agent learned from previous steps. Not pre-planned!

## Entry Points

### 1. After Terraform Errors (Automatic)

When terraform apply/destroy fails, users are prompted:

```
🤖 Autonomous AI Agent Available!

The AI agent will:
  • Analyze the errors autonomously
  • Investigate AWS resources and configuration
  • Identify root causes
  • Apply fixes automatically
  • Verify the solution works

   Start the AI agent? (y/n):
```

### 2. From Main Menu (Manual)

Users can select "🤖 AI Agent - Troubleshoot Issues" to proactively investigate issues.

## TUI Visualization

The agent's TUI shows real-time progress:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🤖 AI Agent - Autonomous Troubleshooter │
│                                         │
│ 🔧 Executing: aws ecs describe-services │
│                                         │
│ Iterations: 3 | Success: 2 | Failed: 0  │
│                                         │
│ ✓ 1. Checked ECS service status         │
│    Output: Service has 0 running tasks  │
│                                         │
│ ✓ 2. Examined task definition           │
│    Output: Invalid IAM role ARN         │
│                                         │
│ → 3. Updating terraform config...       │
│    Action: file_edit (running)          │
│                                         │
│ [↑/↓] Navigate | [q] Stop agent         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Steps appear **dynamically** as the agent creates them, not pre-planned!

## Safety Mechanisms

1. **Iteration Limit**: Max 20 iterations (prevents infinite loops)
2. **Command Timeouts**: 2-15 minutes per action
3. **User Cancellation**: Press 'q' to stop anytime
4. **Environment Isolation**: Works only in selected environment
5. **Audit Trail**: All actions visible in TUI
6. **AWS Credentials**: Uses existing profile
