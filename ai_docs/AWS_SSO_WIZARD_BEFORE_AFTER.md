# AWS SSO Setup: Before vs After

## The Problem We're Solving

Setting up AWS SSO profiles is currently a **multi-step manual process** that requires:
- Reading AWS documentation
- Manually editing `~/.aws/config` files
- Understanding SSO session concepts
- Running multiple CLI commands
- Troubleshooting cryptic errors
- Manually updating YAML files

**Result:** 30+ minutes of frustration for new users, high support burden, and frequent setup failures.

## Before: Manual Setup Process

### Step 1: Read Documentation

User has to find and read:
- AWS SSO documentation
- Meroku infrastructure documentation
- Stack Overflow threads about SSO errors

**Time:** 10-15 minutes

### Step 2: Gather Information

User needs to locate:
- SSO start URL (from AWS admin or documentation)
- AWS account IDs (log into AWS Console for each environment)
- Role names (check IAM or ask admin)
- Regions (remember from project setup)

**Time:** 5-10 minutes

### Step 3: Manually Edit `~/.aws/config`

User opens text editor and types:

```ini
[sso-session mycompany]
sso_start_url = https://mycompany.awsapps.com/start
sso_region = us-east-1
sso_registration_scopes = sso:account:access

[profile dev]
credential_process = aws configure export-credentials --profile dev
sso_session = mycompany
sso_account_id = 123456789012
sso_role_name = AdministratorAccess
region = us-east-1

[profile staging]
credential_process = aws configure export-credentials --profile staging
sso_session = mycompany
sso_account_id = 987654321098
sso_role_name = AdministratorAccess
region = us-west-2

[profile prod]
credential_process = aws configure export-credentials --profile prod
sso_session = mycompany
sso_account_id = 456789012345
sso_role_name = AdministratorAccess
region = us-east-1
```

**Common mistakes:**
- Typos in account IDs
- Wrong indentation
- Missing fields
- Incorrect syntax
- Duplicate sections

**Time:** 10-15 minutes (if everything goes right)

### Step 4: Run SSO Login Commands

User types manually:

```bash
aws sso login --profile dev
# Wait for browser...
# Login to AWS SSO...

aws sso login --profile staging
# Wait for browser again...
# Login again...

aws sso login --profile prod
# Wait for browser again...
# Login again...
```

**Time:** 5-10 minutes

### Step 5: Manually Update YAML Files

User opens each YAML file and adds:

```yaml
# project/dev.yaml
account_id: "123456789012"
aws_profile: "dev"

# project/staging.yaml
account_id: "987654321098"
aws_profile: "staging"

# project/prod.yaml
account_id: "456789012345"
aws_profile: "prod"
```

**Time:** 5 minutes

### Step 6: Debug Inevitable Errors

User encounters errors like:

```
Error: error configuring S3 Backend: no valid credential sources found
```

or

```
Error loading SSO Token: the SSO session has expired or is invalid
```

User has to:
- Google the error
- Check config file for typos
- Verify account IDs are correct
- Re-run commands
- Ask for help in Slack/Discord

**Time:** 10-30 minutes (can be hours for complex issues)

### Total Time: 30-60+ minutes

**Success Rate:** ~60% (many users give up or need help)

2. **Run wizard to add new environments** - Wizard detects existing and adds missing
3. **Run wizard to fix incomplete configs** - Wizard fills in missing fields
4. **Start fresh** - Wizard can recreate everything if needed

### Example: Adding Staging Environment

**User wants:** staging environment

**Before:**
1. Copy dev profile from `~/.aws/config`
2. Edit to change name to staging
3. Look up staging account ID
4. Update account ID
5. Update region if different
6. Save file
7. Run `aws sso login --profile staging`
8. Edit `staging.yaml` to add account ID and profile

**Time:** 10-15 minutes

**After:**
```
./meroku sso setup staging

✅ Found existing SSO session: mycompany
✅ Found existing profiles: dev, prod

Setting up: staging

? AWS Account ID: 987654321098
? Role Name [AdministratorAccess]: ↵
